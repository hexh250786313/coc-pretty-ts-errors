# coc-pretty-ts-errors

Inspired by https://github.com/yoavbls/pretty-ts-errors. This CoC extension is a port of the original extension to work with CoC.

Based on https://github.com/hexh250786313/pretty-ts-errors-markdown.

## Features

- Show TypeScript error messages in a more readable format.
- You can choose to use `doHover` or diagnostic floating window to display error message by option `pretty-ts-errors.mode`.
- There are two ways to highlight code blocks, one is to use the highlight group `PrettyTsErrorType` to highlight a single color, and the other is to use ts syntax highlight.

  â€» Personally, I prefer to use prettytserr to highlight a single color, because it is more readable and does not affect the original code.

## Usage

Make sure you have `coc.nvim` and `coc-tsserver` installed.

And make sure your `coc.nvim` includes the pr https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/commit/9c079ad79d66d4ede7886cc4094a822352559502 which gives diagnostic floating window highlight.

Then run the following command:

```
:CocInstall coc-pretty-ts-errors
```
