# coc-pretty-ts-errors

Inspired by https://github.com/yoavbls/pretty-ts-errors. This CoC extension is a port of the original extension to work with CoC.

Based on https://github.com/hexh250786313/pretty-ts-errors-markdown.

## Features

- Show TypeScript error messages in a more readable format.
- You can choose to use `doHover` or diagnostic floating window to display error message by option `pretty-ts-errors.mode`.
- There are two ways to highlight code blocks, one is to use the highlight group `PrettyTsErrorType` to highlight a single color, and the other is to use ts syntax highlight.

  | `"typescript"` | <img width="333" alt="ts" src="https://github.com/hexh250786313/coc-pretty-ts-errors/assets/26080416/4aa39849-da69-4300-93af-a3293bd86b15"> | Use ts syntax highlight. And for correct syntax highlight it will extra add a `"type Type = "` before type definition in code blocks. |

  â€» Personally, I prefer to use prettytserr to highlight a single color, because it is more readable and does not affect the original code.

## Usage

Make sure you have `coc.nvim` and `coc-tsserver` installed.

And make sure your `coc.nvim` includes the pr https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/commit/9c079ad79d66d4ede7886cc4094a822352559502 which gives diagnostic floating window highlight.

Then run the following command:

```
:CocInstall coc-pretty-ts-errors
```

## Configuration

Here are the available configuration options for coc-pretty-ts-errors:

- `pretty-ts-errors.enable`: (Boolean, default: `true`) Enable or disable the coc-pretty-ts-errors extension.
- `pretty-ts-errors.showLink`: (Boolean, default: `false`) Show ref links in error message.
- `pretty-ts-errors.mode`: (0 | 1 | 2, default: `1`) Display mode of the error message.
- `pretty-ts-errors.codeBlockHighlightType`: ("prettytserr" | "typescript", default: `"prettytserr"`) The way to highlight code block.
- `pretty-ts-errors.serverName`: (String, default: `"tsserver"`) The name of the language server. Set it to 'tsserver' if youse coc-tsserver. Otherwise, set it to your customized typescript language server name.
- `pretty-ts-errors.sourceName`: (String) The name of the source. Same as `serverName` by default.

## Q & A

**Q1: `:CocList diagnostics` has additional error messages from `coc-pretty-ts-errors`.**

**A1**: When choosing to display error messages in the diagnostic floating window (mode `0` and `2`), it will cause `:CocList diagnostics` to have additional error messages from `coc-pretty-ts-errors`. These error messages are formatted copies of the original errors, and there is currently no good way to remove these messages (the same problem also occurs in the diagnostics virtual text at the end of the line). Therefore, I personally recommend using mode `1` with `:call CocActionAsync('doHover')`.

**Q2: The alignment of the markdown list format is a bit strange, and sometimes the indentation is too much.**

**A2**: `coc.nvim` issue: https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/issues/4882

**Q3: eng: When to use `serverName` and `sourceName`**

**A3**: Examples:

- When using [coc-tsserver](/branches/test/README.md) , both `serverName` and `sourceName` are `"tsserver"`
- When using a customized typescript `"languageserver"`, you need to modify `serverName` and `sourceName` to the corresponding values, such as [typescript-language-server](

  ```
  // coc-settings.json
  "pretty-ts-errors.serverName": "my-tsserver",
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~          Your customized typescript language server name.
  "pretty-ts-errors.sourceName": "typescript",
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~          You have to know the source name of your customized typescript language server from its documentation.
                                                        Like coc-tsserver is "tsserver" and typescript-language-server is "typescript".
  "languageserver": {
      "my-tsserver": {
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~          `serverName` is from here.
          "enable": true,
          "command": "typescript-language-server",
          "args": ["--stdio"],

          ...
          ...other options

      }
  }
  ```
